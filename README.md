  ## Installation

  If you would prefer to run this page on your local machine simply clone the repo and run the command `npm i` in your terminal. This will download all the dependencies you need to run the project. 

  ## Usage

  When you reach the landing page simply click on "Get Started" to start taking notes. You will be greeted with a page where you can create notes, view past notes and delete notes. From here it should be pretty self explanatory!
